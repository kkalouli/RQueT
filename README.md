## Models
We make available the most significant models trained within this work. Specifically, we make available the following:
- the NB model trained on the speaker-after feature
- the BERT model fine-tuned on the question and the context-after
- the BERT model fine-tuned on the question and the context-before
- the BERT model fine-tuned only on the question
- the FF model trained on a) the fine-tuned BERT model of question and context-after and b) the speaker-after 
- the SVM model trained on the fine-tuned BERT model of question and context-before
